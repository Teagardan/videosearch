# Technical Writeup: Teagardan Video Deepsearch

## Architecture
Teagardan Video Deepsearch is a Flask-based web application integrated with a video processing pipeline. The system:
- **Video Processing**: Uses FFmpeg and OpenCV to extract frames and detect scene changes via Mean Squared Error (MSE). Supports Casual (faster, low-res) and Pro (detailed, high-res) modes.
- **Audio Transcription**: Employs Whisper to transcribe audio into segments, paired with visual data.
- **Visual Analysis**: Leverages Gemma 3N via Ollama to generate frame and chunk descriptions, using multimodal capabilities.
- **Web Interface**: Flask serves a dynamic UI with "Ask" mode for querying video content (using BM25 ranking) and "Scene" mode for frame-specific analysis.
- **Data Storage**: Saves audio-visual descriptions in JSONL files (`video_text_repo.jsonl`, `frame_text_repo.jsonl`) for efficient retrieval.

## Gemma 3N Usage
The Gemma 3N model (`gemma3n:e4b-it-q8_0`) is central to the project, running locally via Ollama. It:
- Generates detailed visual descriptions for video chunks and individual frames, processing images and context-aware prompts.
- Supports multimodal inputs (text and images) for accurate frame analysis in the web interface.
- Optimizes for Apple Silicon (tested on Mac mini), leveraging unified memory for efficient inference.

## Challenges Overcome
- **Scene Detection Accuracy**: Tuned MSE thresholds (1000 for Casual, 500 for Pro) to balance sensitivity and performance.
- **Resource Constraints**: Implemented batch processing (batch size 20 for Casual, 1 for Pro) to manage memory usage during frame analysis.
- **Context Integration**: Enriched frame-level analysis by incorporating chunk-level audio-visual context, improving query relevance.

## Technical Choices
- **Whisper for Audio**: Chosen for robust speech-to-text performance across diverse audio conditions.
- **BM25 for Ranking**: Efficiently ranks frames based on combined audio-visual text, ensuring relevant query results.
- **JSONL for Storage**: Scalable format for storing timestamps, audio, and visual data, enabling fast retrieval.
- **Flask for Web**: Lightweight and flexible for building an interactive UI with minimal overhead.
- **OpenCV and FFmpeg**: Industry-standard tools for reliable video processing and frame extraction.

This project demonstrates a functional proof-of-concept, with all components integrated to deliver a seamless video search experience, backed by Gemma 3Nâ€™s multimodal capabilities.
